* Why this class?
I am interested in learning coding and thought this class would be a good start in learning something new. I was always interested but never took the initiative to take a computer science class. 
* What on this syllabus scares you?
Nothing.
* What questions do you have about the syllabus?
Nothing.
* What stories do you want to tell?
I major in psychology and my interest is becoming a clinical psychologist. I also have interests in computers. I spend a great amount of time on the computer and want to know if I would enjoy coding.
